# Patient-Health-Monitoring-System
A Java based GUI application that can maintain records of individual patients, their health-related parameters, Doctor’s advice etc. and send reminder to the patient for each clinical test/doctor’s appointment.

I have used JavaFX for GUI, and MySQL for Database. Right now, to run this app you need to create database manually, I will add codes soon for this soon. I have used JPhoenix for Material Design, Twilio for sms api.

To use this app, simply clone the repository, download JDK8 if not already installed, and MySQL. Create necessary databases and tables. Feel Free to Contribute. For any queries contact me through vaibhavshukla2017c@gmail.com
